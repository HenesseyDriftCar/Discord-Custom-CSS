# Discord Custom CSS
## Why would anyone _not_ want my overwhelmingly blue theme that has a very subjective taste?

# Installation
## This CSS works with both BetterDiscord and Vencord.
### There are two ways to download. You can get the full theme from fullTheme.theme.css, or import smaller parts.
### In the case of using the full theme, simply download fullTheme.theme.css, and place it in your client's `theme` folder. It will then be loaded, and all values in `root` can be edited locally in a text editor of your choice.

### If you wish to have more choice over what code is used, you can use a line for each main code section in your client's QuickCSS editor. You can then bring in the code you want with `@import url("https://henesseydriftcar.github.io/Discord-Custom-CSS/CSS/FILE YOU WANT TO IMPORT HERE")`
### However, in this case you will still need to paste the full `customisationRoot.css` file into your QuickCSS editor for the theme to work.

# When imported correctly, the theme should look something like this:
